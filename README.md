The important files of this project are hmm.py and knn_dtw_2.py. These are the files which contain the code with which we got the results we discussed in our paper. Some used functions may be imported from the supporting files such as requirements. This is mentioned at the beginning of each file if this is the case or not.  

All the other files contain bits and pieces of the same methods, but do not alwyas lead to the correct result.
